# 💻 Núcleo Web

This is the Núcleo Web: Some of the web development projects that I (@ribmarciojr) did during the InfoJr Trainee process.

Here you will find front and back-end projects, JavaScript ecosystem based.
Each of this folders is a project, which has its own README.md and instructions to running it.

Feel comfortable to check-up any project and try in your computer. 😉
